### Author's Notes (next steps)

Given more time I would look at the following:

- Error handling for bad API responses
- Not build an SPA for thisâ€¦a page refresh is acceptable after form submission
- Add masking or something to make the input look nicer
- Add better messaging to the user
- Hook up sass or some better style/design system
- More tests
- Better testing setup, e.g. Typescript for jest
